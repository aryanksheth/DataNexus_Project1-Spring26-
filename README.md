### DataNexus_Project1-Spring26

DataNexus is a club that combines the best parts of Statistics, Computer Science, Data Science, Economics, and many more!
We look into pressing problems or questions that society needs answered and make a research project out of it!
This is the README to our first project ever!

### PROJECT 1:
### AI AND AUTOMATION, HOW DOES THIS AFFECT THE JOB MARKET AND HOW CAN WE PLOT THIS TREND TEN YEARS INTO THE FUTURE

First, let us look at what we look at in the past. We are using data from the past ten years because that is the data that is the most relevant with the rise of AI. We then want to forecast job postings over the next 10 years.

We want to possibly look at how skill clusters change over time. We define "skill clusters" as an in-demand choice of skills for a specific genre of jobs. 
For example, a front-end developer skill cluster would be HTML, CSS etc etc.

We do have a more detailed plan of action on our club Google Drive!
